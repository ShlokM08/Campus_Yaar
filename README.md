# CampusYaar

## 📌 Project Overview
CampusYaar is a student-focused platform designed to create a **sustainable circular economy** within university campuses.  
It connects graduating students who want to sell their used essentials (furniture, mattresses, electronics, etc.) with incoming students who are looking for affordable alternatives.  
This project reduces waste, promotes sustainability, and saves money for students.
